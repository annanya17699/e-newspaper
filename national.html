                <h1>Is Kerala the next laboratory for BJP to try out ‘Operation Kamala’?</h1>
                <p>The poll campaign in Kerala has come to an end, along with Easter celebrations, and irrespective of whether or not the BJP improves its tally beyond the single seat it owns in the outgoing assembly, it has been able to establish itself as a party that will continue to sharply focus on religious issues, such as the Sabarimala temple entry and ‘love jihad’. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s three rallies at Palakkad, Thiruvananthapuram and Konni (part of Pathanamthitta district where the Sabarimala shrine is located) have not only energised party cadres, they have enabled leaders to reach out to the influential Christian community troubled over allegations of forced conversions..</p>
